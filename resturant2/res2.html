            <h2>Student Perks:</h2>
            <p>I honestly think one of the best perks in terms fo any place is how convienient it is to go there, this one is 100%
                one of those places, its in the center of UNCG so you always pass by it, and even if you live in one of the corners of campus
                it doesn't matter if you're a student you WILL pass here so grabbing a lunch or dinner here is so easy. You may also use flex here as well.

            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>Chick-Fil-A is open Mon, Tues, Weds, Thurs from 11am-9pm, they are also open on Fridays but are only open from 11am-7pm, and also on Saturdays from 4apm-9pm.
                They specialize in chicken, fries, shakes, and sometimes bagels tho rare they are there to purchase if you so desire. They are located at the EUC so from the petty building
                go to the dining hall, exit through the front by going straight, then head left until you find a big building, its on the first floor behind the stairs.

      <p> Classic, I know but theres a reason why, these are so iconic and amazing, there usually what I typically go there for
        they're crunchy, a bit sour, and you can easily slap some ketchup on it for a slightly sweet tasting feeling, its so awesome and highly recommended.

      <p> I honestly don't understand myself why these are so good, typically McDonalds are where you go for fries since they're awesome, but I find myself
        always coming back to these instead and making sure to get the largest one possible.
        These things are so easier to dip in sauce.

      <p>Never seen anything like this before, that I heard of before I actually tried it, I am a sucker for any burrito with a crunchy sensation inside.
        I just love have both kinds of tastes like that, it. It also can come with sauce to dip in. After a morning class this is a good snack to munch on.
