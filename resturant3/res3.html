            <h2>Student Perks:</h2>
            <p>
            I think the biggest perk of all is coming from the students that live in Jefferson Suites, I used to live there and not only did I help me minimize trips to the hall
            if I find myself not being particularly fond of whats in it currently, or if its very cold and I don't want to be out for long this Bojangles saved my life as a student, it also has its own meal and some specials like that blueberry buscuit. It also gives a discount if flex is used for students with their ID and looking to use their flex.

    <div class="dishyap">
      <img src="res3img/biscuit.jpg" alt="">
      <p> These were the sandwiches I always begged my father to bring me on some cases, their biscuits always made my day, 
        the right Bojangles always make their biscuits crunchy, and alsolutely lovely plus the eggs and bacon complete this dish, its awesome.

    <div class="dishitem">Dish 2: Bo-rounds</div>
    <div class="dishyap">
      <img src="res3img/rounds.jpg" alt="">
      <p> Tho these are techincally hashbrowns in disguise they still are amazing, these always go well with the first dish above or 
        with any biscuits since it gives that nice soft but crunchy salt flavor, and it something easily combined with all and all sauces you'd like.

    <div class="dishitem">Dish 3: Chicken Tenders/Wings</div>
    <div class="dishyap">
      <img src="res3img/tenders.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Not only does getting these come with those amazing biscuits, these are probably one of the best tenders I personally tasted, 
        given this place was already close to my building so it was easy to get the fact that they're also this super duper good is astonishing, 
        I found myself typically buying these combined with the bo-rounds for the ultimate dish and I honestly never strayed far from these three options, 
        they are just that amazing.
