        One of Panda's perks for students is that it comes with a meal students can use their school ID on to swipe themselves a pre-determined meal for themselves using their meal plan, 
        students or myself would use this when I would like to get a pinch of panda and their good chicken while also keeping a hold of my extra flex
        to use on other matters since flex itself is more wide range in terms of its spending while these swipes can only be used at places like panda.</div>

        <div class="description">
        Panda at UNCG is open Mon, Tues, Weds, Thurs from 11am-9pm, they are also open on Fridays but are only open from 11am-7pm, and also on Sundays from 4apm-9pm.
      They specalize in chicken, with their teryaki, orange, honey, and spicy chicken all avaliable to you with some veggie options.
    They are located in the dining hall at UNCG on the first floor to the left if you come from the front, and if you come from the PETTY building it's on the right after going straight until you reach the doors, its pretty in the open
  so you don't have to go searching for it. You can also do take-out on it if you want to bring it home with no extra charge, they also have plenty of sauces to choose from which are neat. </div>

      <img src="res1img/mealone.webp" alt="">
      <p>This dish is probably one of the customer's most common and favorites
        I do work here at panda so its a bit biased but I see plenty of students always 
        grab one of these accidentally. They order the parts of the meal without knowing 
        its already avaliable to them so it must be pretty great

  <div class="dish-card">
    <div id="dish2" class="dishitem">Dish 2: Eggrolls $6.99<button id="btn2" class="food-btn" type="button">Favorite</button></div>
    <div class="dishyap">
      <img src="res1img/eggroll.webp" alt="">
      <p>Eggsrolls are a standard at places like these, and ive always been a sucker for them
      , they're just way too good and have that good mix of soft and crunchy in
      in them, Panda does offer you a spring roll which is a veggie option which is also good but the main one is honestly my personally choice

  <div class="dish-card">
    <div id="dish3" class="dishitem">Dish 3:Walnut honey shrimp $7.99<button id="btn3" class="food-btn" type="button">Favorite</button></div>
    <div class="dishyap">
      <img src="res1img/shrimp.webp" alt="">
      <p>These were also something if I saw I would grab instantly, they have that nice sweet taste to them that
        makes them really good, it also comes with honey glazed walnuts which I didn't think I would enjoy until I 
        was able to get my hands on a good bag of them and pretty much destroyed them
